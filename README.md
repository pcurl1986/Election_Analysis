## Election-Audit Summary

The python script utilized in this analysis can be modified to perform future analyses on project requiring the holding of a vote. For example, if you wanted to analysis a federal congressional election, all you need to do is change the counties to states. Another example, if you had a local initiative election, all you need to do is change candidates to in favor or against.
